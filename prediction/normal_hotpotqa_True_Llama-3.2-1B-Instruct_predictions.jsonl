He established the Kaiser Shipyards, which built Liberty ships during World War II, after which he formed Kaiser Aluminum and Kaiser Steel.  Kaiser organized Kaiser Permanente health care for his workers and their families.  He led Kaiser-Frazer followed by Kaiser Motors, automobile companies known for the safety of their designs.  Kaiser was involved in large construction projects such as civic centers and dams, and invested in real estate.  With his wealth, he established the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit, non-partisan, charitable organization.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The Kaiser Shipyards were seven major shipbuilding yards located on the United States west coast during World War II.  Kaiser ranked 20th among U.S. corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.  The shipyards were owned by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, a creation of American industrialist Henry J. Kaiser, (1882-1967), who established the shipbuilding company around 1939 in order to help meet the construction goals set by the United States Maritime Commission for merchant shipping.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Kaiser Ventures (formerly Kaiser Steel) corporation, headquartered in Ontario, California.  It was founded by Henry J. Kaiser to provide steel plate for the Pacific Coast shipbuilding industry, which expanded during World War II, then shrank, then expanded again during the Korean War.  California Shipbuilding Corporation on Terminal Island, California, was one of these shipyards which built hundreds of Liberty ships and Victory ships in World War II, and was also a project of Henry Kaiser.

He was one of the few European commanders who gained a victory over the Mahdists before Kitchener's Expedition, soundly defeating them at Agordat in 1893.  After a long and successfull colonial service, he died in combat at Adwa, and was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The Treaty of Addis Ababa, signed 23 October 1896, formally ended the First Italo–Ethiopian War on terms mostly favorable to Ethiopia.  This treaty superseded a secret agreement between Ethiopia and Italy negotiated days after the decisive Battle of Adwa in March of the same year, in which Ethiopian forces commanded by Menelik II defeated the Italians.  The most important concession the Italians made was the abrogation of the Treaty of Wuchale and recognizing Ethiopia as an independent country.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The First Italo-Ethiopian War was fought between Italy and Ethiopia from 1895 to 1896.  It originated from a disputed treaty which, the Italians claimed, turned the country into an Italian protectorate.  Italy was supported by the two other triple alliance members Germany and Austria.  Much to their surprise, they found that Ethiopian ruler Menelik II, rather than being opposed by some of his traditional enemies, was supported by them, so the Italian army, invading Ethiopia from Italian Eritrea in 1893, faced a more united front than they expected.  In addition, Ethiopia was supported by Russia, an Orthodox Christian nation like Ethiopia with military advisers, army training, and the sale of weapons for Ethiopian forces during the war.  Ethiopia was also supported diplomatically by the United Kingdom and France in order to prevent Italy from becoming a colonial competitor.  Full-scale war broke out in 1895, with Italian troops having initial success until Ethiopian troops counterattacked Italian positions and besieged the Italian fort of Meqele, forcing its surrender.  Italian defeat came about after the Battle of Adwa, where the Ethiopian army dealt the heavily outnumbered Italians a decisive blow and forced their retreat back into Eritrea.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The Battle of Adwa (Amharic: አድዋ; Amharic translated: Adowa, or sometimes by the Italian name \"Adua\") was fought on 2 March 1896/Yekatit 23, 1889 according to Ethiopian calendar between the Ethiopian Empire and the Kingdom of Italy near the town of Adwa, Ethiopia, in Tigray.  This climactic battle of the First Italo-Ethiopian War, was a decisive defeat for Italy and secured Ethiopian sovereignty.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Ethiopia is a landlocked sovereign country located in the Horn of Africa.  Ethiopia is bordered by Eritrea to the north, Sudan to the west, South Sudan to the south-west, Kenya to the south, Somalia to the east and Djibouti to the north-east.  Ethiopia is one of the oldest countries in the world and Africa's second-most populous nation.  Ethiopia has yielded some of humanity's oldest traces, making the area important in the history of human evolution.  Recent studies claim that the vicinity of present-day Addis Ababa was the point from which human beings migrated around the world.  Ethiopian dynastic history traditionally began with the reign of Emperor Menelik I in 1000 BC.  The roots of the Ethiopian state are similarly deep, dating with unbroken continuity to at least the Aksumite Empire (which adopted the name \"Ethiopia\" in the 4th century) and its predecessor state, D`mt (with early 1st millennium BC roots).  After a period of decentralized power in the 18th and early 19th centuries known as the Zemene Mesafint (\"Era of the Judges/Princes\"), the country was reunited in 1855 by Kassa Hailu, who became Emperor Tewodros II, beginning Ethiopia's modern history.  Ethiopia's borders underwent significant territorial expansion to its modern borders for the rest of the century, especially by Emperor Menelik II and Ras Gobena, culminating in its victory over the Italians at the Battle of Adwa in 1896 with the military leadership of Ras Makonnen, and ensuring its sovereignty and freedom from colonization.  It was brutally occupied by Benito Mussolini's Fascist Italy from 1936 to 1941, ending with its liberation by British Empire and Ethiopian Patriot forces.</DOCUMENT>\n\n\nAnswer the question briefly and directly in one short phrase by using the information given in the context above.Here, 'Context' is a set of separate passages retrieved by a RAG system and may contain both relevant and irrelevant or noisy information, so base your reasoning only on the parts that are clearly supported by the text.assistant\n\nThe battle in which Giuseppe Arimondi lost his life secured Ethiopia's sovereignty for the First Italo-Ethiopian War.", "gold_answer": ["sovereignty"], "used_docs": ["Giuseppe Edoardo Arimondi, OSML, OMS, OCI (Savigliano, 26 April 1846 – Adwa, 1 March 1896) was an Italian general, mostly known for his role during the First Italo-Ethiopian War.

In addition, Ethiopia was supported by Russia, an Orthodox Christian nation like Ethiopia with military advisers, army training, and the sale of weapons for Ethiopian forces during the war.  Ethiopia was also supported diplomatically by the United Kingdom and France in order to prevent Italy from becoming a colonial competitor.  Full-scale war broke out in 1895, with Italian troops having initial success until Ethiopian troops counterattacked Italian positions and besieged the Italian fort of Meqele, forcing its surrender.  Italian defeat came about after the Battle of Adwa, where the Ethiopian army dealt the heavily outnumbered Italians a decisive blow and forced their retreat back into Eritrea.", "The Battle of Adwa (Amharic: አድዋ; Amharic translated: Adowa, or sometimes by the Italian name \"Adua\") was fought on 2 March 1896/Yekatit 23, 1889 according to Ethiopian calendar between the Ethiopian Empire and the Kingdom of Italy near the town of Adwa, Ethiopia, in Tigray.  This climactic battle of the First Italo-Ethiopian War, was a decisive defeat for Italy and secured Ethiopian sovereignty.", "Ethiopia is a landlocked sovereign country located in the Horn of Africa.  Ethiopia is bordered by Eritrea to the north, Sudan to the west, South Sudan to the south-west, Kenya to the south, Somalia to the east and Djibouti to the north-east.  Ethiopia is one of the oldest countries in the world and Africa's second-most populous nation.  Ethiopia has yielded some of humanity's oldest traces, making the area important in the history of human evolution.  Recent studies claim that the vicinity of present-day Addis Ababa was the point from which human beings migrated around the world.  Ethiopian dynastic history traditionally began with the reign of Emperor Menelik I in 1000 BC.  The roots of the Ethiopian state are similarly deep, dating with unbroken continuity to at least the Aksumite Empire (which adopted the name \"Ethiopia\" in the 4th century) and its predecessor state, D`mt (with early 1st millennium BC roots).  After a period of decentralized power in the 18th and early 19th centuries known as the Zemene Mesafint (\"Era of the Judges/Princes\"), the country was reunited in 1855 by Kassa Hailu, who became Emperor Tewodros II, beginning Ethiopia's modern history.  Ethiopia's borders underwent significant territorial expansion to its modern borders for the rest of the century, especially by Emperor Menelik II and Ras Gobena, culminating in its victory over the Italians at the Battle of Adwa in 1896 with the military leadership of Ras Makonnen, and ensuring its sovereignty and freedom from colonization.  It was brutally occupied by Benito Mussolini's Fascist Italy from 1936 to 1941, ending with its liberation by British Empire and Ethiopian Patriot forces."], "use_rag": true, "ft_mode": "normal", "time": 1.7431342601776123, "peak_vram_mb": 0}

Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981), was a decision of the United States Supreme Court holding that the practice of requiring only men to register for the draft was constitutional.  After extensive hearings, floor debate and committee sessions on the matter, the United States Congress enacted the law, as it had previously been, to apply to men only.  Several attorneys, including Robert L. Goldberg, subsequently challenged the gender distinction as unconstitutional.  (The named defendant is Bernard D.

The third incarnation of the draft came into being in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act.  It was the country's first peacetime draft.  From 1940 until 1973, during both peacetime and periods of conflict, men were drafted to fill vacancies in the United States Armed Forces that could not be filled through voluntary means.  The draft was ended when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all-volunteer military force.

The President's order stated that the federal government would not hire any person based on their race, color, creed, or national origin.  The FEPC enforced the order to ban discriminatory hiring within the federal government and in corporations that received federal contracts.  Millions of blacks and women achieved better jobs and better pay as a result.  The war brought the race issue to the forefront.  The Army and Navy had been segregated since the Civil War.

Philip Randolph, the leading African-American trade unionist, Roosevelt signed an executive order establishing the Fair Employment Practice Committee and prohibiting discrimination by any government agency, including the armed forces.  In practice the services, particularly the Navy and the Marines, found ways to evade this order — the Marine Corps remained all-white until 1942.  In September 1942, at Eleanor's instigation, Roosevelt met with a delegation of African-American leaders, who demanded full integration into the forces, including the right to serve in combat roles and in the Navy, the Marine Corps and the United States Army Air Forces.

During the Iron Age the region, like all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth, was dominated by the Celtic Britons and the Brittonic language.  The Romans, who began their conquest of Britain in AD 43, first campaigned in what is now northeast Wales in 48 against the Deceangli, and gained total control of the region with their defeat of the Ordovices in 79.  The Romans departed from Britain in the 5th century, opening the door for the Anglo-Saxon invasion.  Thereafter Brittonic language and culture began to splinter, and several distinct groups formed.  The Welsh people were the largest of these groups, and are generally discussed independently of the other surviving Brittonic-speaking peoples after the 11th century."], "use_rag": true, "ft_mode": "normal", "time": 1.880523681640625, "peak_vram_mb": 0}

The 1971 FECA required candidates to disclose sources of campaign contributions and campaign expenditures.  The 1974 Amendments essentially rewrote the Act from top to bottom.  The 1974 Amendments placed statutory limits on contributions by individuals for the first time, and created the Federal Election Commission (FEC) as an independent enforcement agency.  It provided for broad new disclosure requirements, and limited the amounts that candidates could spend on their campaigns, or that citizens could spend separate from candidate campaigns to promote their political views.  Specifically, it attempted to restrict the influence of wealthy individuals by limiting individual donations to $1,000 and donations by political action committees (PACs) to $5,000.

Burge and produced by Aaron Spelling and his production company Spelling Television, with Brad Kern serving as showrunner.  The series was originally broadcast by The WB for eight seasons from October 7, 1998, until May 21, 2006.  The series narrative follows a trio of sisters, known as The Charmed Ones, the most powerful good witches of all time, who use their combined \"Power of Three\" to protect innocent lives from evil beings such as demons and warlocks.  Each sister possesses unique magical powers that grow and evolve, while they attempt to maintain normal lives in modern-day San Francisco.  Keeping their supernatural identities separate and secret from their ordinary lives often becomes a challenge for them, with the exposure of magic having far-reaching consequences on their various relationships and resulting in a number of police and FBI investigations throughout the series.  The series initially focuses on the three Halliwell sisters, Prue (Shannen Doherty), Piper (Holly Marie Combs) and Phoebe (Alyssa Milano).  However, following Prue's death in the third-season finale, their long-lost half sister Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan) assumes her place within the \"Power of Three\" from season four onwards."], "use_rag": true, "ft_mode": "normal", "time": 1.231360912322998, "peak_vram_mb": 0}

Harrison began writing the song in 1967, while he was a member of the Beatles, in response to the public outcry surrounding bandmate Paul McCartney's admission that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug LSD.  McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity.

It was Harrison's second composition in the Indian classical style, after \"Love You To\", and was inspired by his six-week stay in India with his mentor and sitar teacher, Ravi Shankar, over September–October 1966.  Recorded in London without the other Beatles, the song features Indian instrumentation such as sitar, dilruba and tabla, and was performed by Harrison and members of the Asian Music Circle.  The recording marked a significant departure from the Beatles' previous work; musically, it evokes the Indian devotional tradition, while the overtly spiritual quality of the lyrics reflects Harrison's absorption in Hindu philosophy and the teachings of the Vedas.

The lyrics reflect Harrison's uneasy feelings towards the Beatles' legacy, three years after the group's break-up, and serve as his statement of independence from expectations raised by the band's unprecedented popularity.  Some music critics and biographers suggest that he wrote the song during a period of personal anguish, following the acclaim he had received as a solo artist with the 1970 triple album \"All Things Must Pass\" and his 1971–72 Bangladesh aid project.

With a favorable upper-level environment and warm sea surface temperatures, it rapidly intensified to attain peak winds of 235 km/h (145 mph) on June 4, according to the India Meteorological Department.  Gonu weakened after encountering dry air and cooler waters, and early on June 6, it made landfall on the easternmost tip of Oman, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the Arabian Peninsula.

The disturbance quickly strengthened, becoming a moderate tropical storm on February 4 and a severe tropical storm the following day.  After a brief period of slower intensification, Hondo rapidly intensified into an intense tropical cyclone and reached its peak intensity with winds of 215 km/h (130 mph ) on February 7.  The cyclone gradually weakened over the next several days due to an increase in forward speed and a decrease in sea surface temperatures.  On February 12, Hondo rapidly degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area.  Over the following week, the remnant low traveled in a general west-northwest direction with no development.  On February 20, about 2,780 km (1,725 mi) northeast of where the final advisories were issued, the storm began to regenerate.  The next day, advisories were issued on Tropical Disturbance Ex-Hondo, which briefly strengthened into a tropical depression.  However, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, Hondo continued to strengthen and attained winds of 95 km/h (60 mph ) before passing directly over Réunion.

The disturbance gradually strengthened as it took a west-northwesterly path, reaching cyclonic storm strength the next day.  Taking advantage of highly favorable conditions, the storm rapidly intensified, attaining super cyclonic storm intensity on 28 October before peaking with winds of 260 km/h (160 mph) and a record-low pressure of 912 mbar (hPa; 26.93 inHg).

He plays the Sarod.  His \"Dhrupadee Veenkar\" style of Ustad Alauddin Khan's Seni Veenkar Gharana: analytically imaginative prosodic progression with metrical waves of melodic phrases interwoven with highest order of technical brilliance and maturity reminds the great legends of the Gharana.  He is an internationally recognized instructor of classical Indian music.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The sarod (or sarode) (सरोद) is a stringed instrument of India, used mainly in Indian classical music.  Along with the sitar, it is among the most popular and prominent instruments in Hindustani classical music.  The sarod is known for a deep, weighty, introspective sound, in contrast with the sweet, overtone-rich texture of the sitar, with sympathetic strings that give it a resonant, reverberant quality.  It is a fretless instrument able to produce the continuous slides between notes known as meend (glissandi), which are important in Indian music.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The sousaphone ( ), is a brass instrument in the same family as the more widely known tuba.  Created around 1893 by J.W. Pepper at the direction of American bandleader John Philip Sousa (whom the instrument was then named after), it was designed to be easier to play than the concert tuba while standing or marching, as well as to carry the sound of the instrument above the heads of the band.  Like the tuba, sound is produced by moving air past the lips, causing them to vibrate or \"buzz\" into a large cupped mouthpiece.  Unlike the tuba, the instrument is bent in a circle to fit around the body of the musician; it ends in a large, flaring bell that is pointed forward, projecting the sound ahead of the player.  Because of the ease of carrying and the direction of sound, it is widely employed in marching bands, as well as various other musical genres.  Sousaphones were originally made out of brass but in the mid-20th century started to be made from lighter materials like fiberglass; today both types are in wide use.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Accompaniment is the musical parts which provide the rhythmic and/or harmonic support for the melody or main themes of a song or instrumental piece.  There are many different styles and types of accompaniment in different genres and styles of music.  In homophonic music, the main accompaniment approach used in popular music, a clear vocal melody is supported by subordinate chords.  In popular music and traditional music, the accompaniment parts typically provide the \"beat\" for the music and outline the chord progression of the song or instrumental piece.  The accompaniment for a vocal melody or instrumental solo can be played by a single musician playing an instrument such as piano, pipe organ, or guitar.  While any instrument can in theory be used as an accompaniment instrument, keyboard and guitar-family instruments tend to be used if there is only a single instrument, as these instruments can play chords and basslines simultaneously (chords and a bassline are easier to play simultaneously on keyboard instruments, but a fingerpicking guitarist can play chords and a bassline simultaneously on guitar).  A solo singer can accompany herself by playing guitar or piano while she sings, and in some rare cases, a solo singer can even accompany himself or herself just using his or her voice and body (e.g., Bobby McFerrin).</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>An experimental musical instrument (or custom-made instrument) is a musical instrument that modifies or extends an existing instrument or class of instruments, or defines or creates a new class of instrument.

It belongs to the dogbane family, Apocynaceae.  \"Pachypodium\" comes from a Latin form from Greek \"pachus\" (thick) and \"podion\" (foot) (or Gk podos, root form of pous, foot), hence meaning \"thick-footed\".</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Stenocereus (Gk.  stenos, narrow, L. cereus, candle) is a genus of columnar or tree-like cacti from the Baja California Peninsula and other parts of Mexico, Arizona in the United States, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Venezuela and the ABC islands of the Dutch Caribbean.  The genus has been enlarged by the addition of species from several other genera.  A close relative is the peculiar chinoa or chende cactus, \"Polaskia chende\".</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The Bottle tree (\"Pachypodium lealii\" Welw.)  is a species of plant included in the \"genus\" \"Pachypodium\".  The scientific name derives from the 19th century Portuguese geologist Fernando da Costa Leal, who described the Bottle tree during an exploration in southern Angola.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Calochilus, commonly known as beard orchids, is a genus of about 30 species of plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.  Beard orchids are terrestrial, herbs with a single leaf at the base of the plant, or no leaves.  Their most striking feature is a densely hairy labellum, giving rise to their common name.  Beard orchids, unlike some other Australian orchids, do not reproduce using daughter tubers, but self-pollinate when cross-pollination has not occurred.

The sole species, Dictyosperma album, is widely cultivated in the tropics but has been farmed to near extinction in its native habitat.  It is commonly called princess palm or hurricane palm, the latter owing to its ability to withstand strong winds by easily shedding leaves.

This was the second time British India invaded Afghanistan.  The war ended after the British emerged victorious against the Afghan rebels and the Afghans agreed to let the British attain all of their geopolitical objectives from the Treaty of Gandamak.  Most of the British and Indian soldiers withdrew from Afghanistan.  The Afghan tribes were permitted to maintain internal rule and local customs but they had to cede control of the area's foreign relations to the British, who, in turn, guaranteed the area's freedom from foreign military domination as a buffer between the British Raj and the Russian Empire.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The Treaty of Gandamak officially ended the first phase of the Second Anglo-Afghan War.  Mohammad Yaqub Khan ceded various frontier areas to Britain while retaining full sovereignty over Afghanistan.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The Emirate of Afghanistan (Pashto: د افغانستان امارت‎ \"Da Afghānistān Amārat \") was an emirate between Central Asia and South Asia, which is today's Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.  The emirate emerged from the Durrani Empire, when Dost Mohammed Khan, the founder of the Barakzai dynasty in Kabul, prevailed.  The history of the Emirate was dominated by 'the Great Game' between the Russian Empire and the United Kingdom for supremacy in Central Asia.  This period was characterized by the expansion of European colonial interests in South Asia.  The Emirate of Afghanistan continued the war with the Sikh Empire, which led to the invasion of Afghanistan by British-led Indian forces who completely wiped out the Afghans in 1842 but did not fulfil their initial war objectives.  However, during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, the British again defeated the Afghans and this time the British took control of Afghanistan's foreign affairs until Emir Amanullah Khan regained them after the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 was signed following the Third Anglo-Afghan War.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Shagai Plateau, also referred to as Shagai Heights is an area of flat lands along the Khyber Pass.  Fort Al Creator was nearby.  The ascent to the Shagai Plateau begins near the entrance to the Khyber Pass from the southeast at Peshawar in what is now Pakistan.  It was the site of a British encampment during the Second Anglo-Afghan War which began in November 1878 when Great Britain, fearful of what it saw as growing Russian influence in Afghanistan, invaded the country from British India.  The first phase of the war ended in May 1879 with the Treaty of Gandamak, which permitted the Afghans to maintain internal sovereignty but forced them to cede control over their foreign policy to the British.  Fighting resumed in September 1879, after an anti-British uprising in Kabul, and finally concluded in September 1880 with the decisive Battle of Kandahar.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The Afghan Civil War fought between 1996 and 2001 was part of the wider War in Afghanistan ongoing since 1978.  In 1996 the Taliban captured the Afghan capital Kabul and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.  The Islamic State of Afghanistan government remained the internationally recognized government of Afghanistan.  The Taliban's Emirate received recognition only from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.  The defense minister of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, Ahmad Shah Massoud, created the United Front (Northern Alliance) in opposition to the Taliban.  The United Front included all Afghan ethnicities: Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras, Turkmens, some Pashtuns and others.

This was the second time British India invaded Afghanistan.  The war ended after the British emerged victorious against the Afghan rebels and the Afghans agreed to let the British attain all of their geopolitical objectives from the Treaty of Gandamak.  Most of the British and Indian soldiers withdrew from Afghanistan.  The Afghan tribes were permitted to maintain internal rule and local customs but they had to cede control of the area's foreign relations to the British, who, in turn, guaranteed the area's freedom from foreign military domination as a buffer between the British Raj and the Russian Empire.", "The Treaty of Gandamak officially ended the first phase of the Second Anglo-Afghan War.  Mohammad Yaqub Khan ceded various frontier areas to Britain while retaining full sovereignty over Afghanistan.", "The Emirate of Afghanistan (Pashto: د افغانستان امارت‎ \"Da Afghānistān Amārat \") was an emirate between Central Asia and South Asia, which is today's Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.  The emirate emerged from the Durrani Empire, when Dost Mohammed Khan, the founder of the Barakzai dynasty in Kabul, prevailed.  The history of the Emirate was dominated by 'the Great Game' between the Russian Empire and the United Kingdom for supremacy in Central Asia.  This period was characterized by the expansion of European colonial interests in South Asia.  The Emirate of Afghanistan continued the war with the Sikh Empire, which led to the invasion of Afghanistan by British-led Indian forces who completely wiped out the Afghans in 1842 but did not fulfil their initial war objectives.  However, during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, the British again defeated the Afghans and this time the British took control of Afghanistan's foreign affairs until Emir Amanullah Khan regained them after the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 was signed following the Third Anglo-Afghan War.", "Shagai Plateau, also referred to as Shagai Heights is an area of flat lands along the Khyber Pass.  Fort Al Creator was nearby.  The ascent to the Shagai Plateau begins near the entrance to the Khyber Pass from the southeast at Peshawar in what is now Pakistan.  It was the site of a British encampment during the Second Anglo-Afghan War which began in November 1878 when Great Britain, fearful of what it saw as growing Russian influence in Afghanistan, invaded the country from British India.  The first phase of the war ended in May 1879 with the Treaty of Gandamak, which permitted the Afghans to maintain internal sovereignty but forced them to cede control over their foreign policy to the British.  Fighting resumed in September 1879, after an anti-British uprising in Kabul, and finally concluded in September 1880 with the decisive Battle of Kandahar.", "The Afghan Civil War fought between 1996 and 2001 was part of the wider War in Afghanistan ongoing since 1978.  In 1996 the Taliban captured the Afghan capital Kabul and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.  The Islamic State of Afghanistan government remained the internationally recognized government of Afghanistan.  The Taliban's Emirate received recognition only from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.  The defense minister of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, Ahmad Shah Massoud, created the United Front (Northern Alliance) in opposition to the Taliban.  The United Front included all Afghan ethnicities: Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras, Turkmens, some Pashtuns and others.

However, more recent research extends early modern revenge tragedy to the 1560s with poet and classicist Jasper Heywood's translations of Seneca at Oxford University, including \"Troas\" (1559), \"Thyestes\" (1560), and \"Hercules Furens\" (1561).  Additionally, Thomases Norton and Sackville's play \"Gorbuduc\" (1561) is considered an early revenge tragedy (almost twenty years prior to \"The Spanish Tragedy\").  Other well-known revenge tragedies include William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" (c.1599-1602) and \"Titus Andronicus\" (c.1588-1593) and Thomas Middleton's \"The Revenger's Tragedy\" (c.1606).</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Meg Ryan (born Margaret Mary Emily Anne Hyra; November 19, 1961) is an American actress, director, and producer.

Ashley H. Thorndike formally established this genre in his seminal 1902 article \"The Relations of Hamlet to Contemporary Revenge Plays,\" which characterizes revenge tragedy \"as a tragedy whose leading motive is revenge and whose main action deals with the progress of this revenge, leading to the death of the murderers and often the death of the avenger himself.\"  Thomas Kyd's \"The Spanish Tragedy\" (c.1580s) is often considered the inaugural revenge tragedy on the early modern stage.  However, more recent research extends early modern revenge tragedy to the 1560s with poet and classicist Jasper Heywood's translations of Seneca at Oxford University, including \"Troas\" (1559), \"Thyestes\" (1560), and \"Hercules Furens\" (1561).  Additionally, Thomases Norton and Sackville's play \"Gorbuduc\" (1561) is considered an early revenge tragedy (almost twenty years prior to \"The Spanish Tragedy\").  Other well-known revenge tragedies include William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" (c.1599-1602) and \"Titus Andronicus\" (c.1588-1593) and Thomas Middleton's \"The Revenger's Tragedy\" (c.1606).", "Meg Ryan (born Margaret Mary Emily Anne Hyra; November 19, 1961) is an American actress, director, and producer.
