There are published records that show the Society existed as early as 1905.  In its early years, the organization moved to and from various locations throughout Manhattan.  AT that time it was basically a gentlemen's club of members who were interested in all types of model building.  In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York.  This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York City's Central Park for model motor boat races.  It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad \" The Union Connecting\".  Over the next twenty years, the Society moved from its original location to two other locations.  Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout.  During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces.  Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled.  The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort.  The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort.  As members returned after the War a new location was searched for.  This led to an invitation from the Lackawanna Railroad to move into their Passenger Terminal in Hoboken,NJ.  They had the space for what would become the largest model railroad in the world at that time.  The space?  Only the ornate waiting room for the recently discontinued ferry boats to 23rd Street in New York City.  Here the layout was built.  It was based on the Lackawanna Railroad from Hoboken to Scranton, Pa.  It was magnificent; from the scale model of the Hoboken Terminal to the soaring Delaware Water Gap.  During the early-1950s the organization moved to its current location in Carlstadt, New Jersey.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Just Another Romantic Wrestling Comedy is a 2006 film starring April Hunter and Joanie Laurer.

There are published records that show the Society existed as early as 1905.  In its early years, the organization moved to and from various locations throughout Manhattan.  AT that time it was basically a gentlemen's club of members who were interested in all types of model building.  In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York.  This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York City's Central Park for model motor boat races.  It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad \" The Union Connecting\".  Over the next twenty years, the Society moved from its original location to two other locations.  Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout.  During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces.  Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled.  The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort.  The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort.  As members returned after the War a new location was searched for.  This led to an invitation from the Lackawanna Railroad to move into their Passenger Terminal in Hoboken,NJ.  They had the space for what would become the largest model railroad in the world at that time.  The space?  Only the ornate waiting room for the recently discontinued ferry boats to 23rd Street in New York City.  Here the layout was built.  It was based on the Lackawanna Railroad from Hoboken to Scranton, Pa.  It was magnificent; from the scale model of the Hoboken Terminal to the soaring Delaware Water Gap.  During the early-1950s the organization moved to its current location in Carlstadt, New Jersey.", "Just Another Romantic Wrestling Comedy is a 2006 film starring April Hunter and Joanie Laurer.

Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure.  Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's.  Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed.  Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion.  Thus the birth of Modifications.  It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance.  FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence.  Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal.  Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash.  Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them.  Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s.  During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.  During the so-called \"Great Recession\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.  It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.  Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.

Identify the arena where the Lewiston Maineiacs played home games. The context states:  \n   ##begin_quote## \"The Lewiston Maineiacs were a junior ice hockey team of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League based in Lewiston, Maine. The team played its home games at the Androscoggin Bank Colisée.\" ##end_quote##  \n   This tells us the arena is the Androscoggin Bank Colisée.\n\n2. Find the seating capacity of the Androscoggin Bank Colisée. The context provides:  \n   ##begin_quote## \"The Androscoggin Bank Colisée (formerly Central Maine Civic Center and Lewiston Colisee) is a 4,000 capacity (3,677 seated) multi-purpose arena, in Lewiston, Maine, that opened in 1958.\" ##end_quote##  \n   This clearly states the seating capacity is 4,000.\n\n3. Confirm that the seating capacity matches the question. The question asks how many people the arena can seat, and the context explicitly states the capacity is 4,000.\n\nTherefore, based on the context, the Androscoggin Bank Colisée, where the Lewiston Maineiacs played home games, can seat 4,000 people.\n\n<ANSWER>: 4,000", "gold_answer": ["3,677 seated"], "used_docs": ["The Androscoggin Bank Colisée (formerly Central Maine Civic Center and Lewiston Colisee) is a 4,000 capacity (3,677 seated) multi-purpose arena, in Lewiston, Maine, that opened in 1958.

Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure.  Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's.  Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed.  Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion.  Thus the birth of Modifications.  It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance.  FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence.  Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal.  Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash.  Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them.  Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s.  During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.  During the so-called \"Great Recession\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.  It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.  Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.  Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public.

The question asks about a device that controls the program Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with, aside from the Apple Remote.\n\n2. From the context, we know that the Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with the Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5.\n\n3. The context states: ##begin_quote## \"The device was originally designed to interact with the Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5 and is compatible with some later desktop and portable Macintosh computers.\" ##end_quote##\n\n4. This indicates that the Apple Remote was originally designed to control the Front Row media program.\n\n5. The question asks for a device that controls the program Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with, aside from the Apple Remote.\n\n6. The context provides a solution: \"The first three generations of Apple TV used the Apple Remote as their primary control mechanism.\"\n\n7. This shows that the Apple Remote was originally designed to control the Apple TV, which is a device that controls the program Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with.\n\n8. Therefore, aside from the Apple Remote, a device that controls the program Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with is the Apple TV.\n\nThis reasoning aligns with the gold answer provided.\n\n<ANSWER>: Apple TV", "gold_answer": ["keyboard function keys"], "used_docs": ["Apple Watch (stylized as WATCH) is a line of smartwatches developed, designed, and marketed by Apple Inc.

Its general ideology was revolutionary socialism of democratic socialist and agrarian socialist forms.  After the February Revolution of 1917, it shared power with other liberal and democratic socialist forces within the Russian Provisional Government.  In November 1917, it won a plurality of the national vote in Russia's first-ever democratic elections (to the Russian Constituent Assembly), but the October Revolution had changed the political landscape and the Bolsheviks disbanded the Constituent Assembly in January 1918.  The SRs soon split into pro-Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik factions.

The Bolsheviks formed the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, marking the beginning of the Russian Civil War between the revolutionary Reds and the counter-revolutionary Whites.  In 1922 the Communist Reds were victorious, and formed the Soviet Union.  Lenin died in 1924, starting a power struggle which ended with Joseph Stalin seizing power.

The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants.

The question states: \"The Album Against the Wind was the 11th Album of a Rock singer Robert C Seger born May 6 1945. What was the Rock singer's stage name?\"\n\n2. From the context, we have the following relevant information:  \n   ##begin_quote##  \n   \"Robert Clark Seger (, born May 6, 1945) is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist and pianist.

He was one of 24 ballplayers who profited from the advent of MLB free agency following the 1976 season.  A torn rotator cuff rendered his playing career into a cautionary tale of the risks of signing pitchers to free-agent contracts of seven years or longer.  The article outlined how Garland was constantly criticized by Cleveland's incompetent management for not living up to his contract (even though his decline in performance was entirely due to a serious arm injury that could not be fixed effectively by mid-1970's sports medicine) and had fans savagely booing him and even vandalizing his car during games.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The Atlanta Braves are a professional baseball team based in Atlanta, Georgia.

The Braves were a charter member of the NL in 1876 as the Boston Red Caps, and are one of the NL's two remaining charter franchises (the other being the Chicago Cubs).

Block Ave. It is one of the oldest bars in Northwest Arkansas.  Marjorie Maxine Miller opened the bar in 1950 when she was 24 years old with money she borrowed from her parents.  She managed to pay her parents back within the year.  In 1960 she tore down the old wooden building in which the bar had been located and had the current building—a long, narrow brick structure—built in its place.  The new building had only one window, exactly 8.5 in by 40 in, in the front, which was the minimum size allowed by the building codes at the time.  This was more than likely a business decision aimed at limiting break-ins.  Other examples of Miller's shrewd business style include keeping a club behind the bar, having only a pay phone available, and trying to hire football players as employees so the team would follow as patrons, a business style that led to the bar's longevity and success.  Adding to the Tap Room's charm were a 50 ft -long bar that stretched nearly the entire length of the building and dominated the room, an old coin-operated cigarette machine, a juke box that still played 45s, and a deer head adorned with Mardi Gras beads, sunglasses and a tie.  Miller was a constant figure behind the cash register for 50 years until her health started to decline around 2000.  She died at age 82 in May 2006.  A month later the Tap Room caught fire.  Due to lack of insurance the bar was closed for over a year, reopening in August 2007.  Most of the furniture inside the bar was replaced, including the bar.  The exposed rafters darkened by the fire were simply painted black, and a skylight was installed where the roof had burned through.  Considerable efforts were made to retain many things that had been in the bar for a very long time, such as the older lights and signs.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Aquinas Old Collegians Football Club, nicknamed the Bloods, is an amateur Australian rules football club in Ringwood, Victoria, playing in the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA).

It is one of the original high school rugby clubs which are part of the Georgia High School Rugby Association (GHSRA).  The club was founded in 2005, and has made its mark on rugby in Georgia.  Matches and practices are held at Noonday Creek Park in Marietta.  Coach Randall Joseph has been the head coach since the club's founding, with Anthony \"Bubba\" Gautney as assistant coach.  The club has taken park in many tournaments and state final matches in Georgia and the Southeast United States.  A major goal of the Trojans Rugby Football Club is to teach and play the sport of rugby in the United States.  This is a great struggle throughout Georgia because of opposition from the high school's football coaches and athletic directors.  The club plays the most common version of rugby, called rugby union but often just referred to as rugby.  Although the club plays by rugby union rules, they also play by the rules of the International Rugby Board (IRB) for those under 19 years of age.

Block Ave. It is one of the oldest bars in Northwest Arkansas.  Marjorie Maxine Miller opened the bar in 1950 when she was 24 years old with money she borrowed from her parents.  She managed to pay her parents back within the year.  In 1960 she tore down the old wooden building in which the bar had been located and had the current building—a long, narrow brick structure—built in its place.  The new building had only one window, exactly 8.5 in by 40 in , in the front, which was the minimum size allowed by the building codes at the time.  This was more than likely a business decision aimed at limiting break-ins.  Other examples of Miller's shrewd business style include keeping a club behind the bar, having only a pay phone available, and trying to hire football players as employees so the team would follow as patrons, a business style that led to the bar's longevity and success.  Adding to the Tap Room's charm were a 50 ft -long bar that stretched nearly the entire length of the building and dominated the room, an old coin-operated cigarette machine, a juke box that still played 45s, and a deer head adorned with Mardi Gras beads, sunglasses and a tie.  Miller was a constant figure behind the cash register for 50 years until her health started to decline around 2000.  She died at age 82 in May 2006.  A month later the Tap Room caught fire.  Due to lack of insurance the bar was closed for over a year, reopening in August 2007.  Most of the furniture inside the bar was replaced, including the bar.  The exposed rafters darkened by the fire were simply painted black, and a skylight was installed where the roof had burned through.  Considerable efforts were made to retain many things that had been in the bar for a very long time, such as the older lights and signs.", "Aquinas Old Collegians Football Club, nicknamed the Bloods, is an amateur Australian rules football club in Ringwood, Victoria, playing in the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA).

The name means \"Fruita tooth\", in reference to Fruita, Colorado (USA), where its fossils were first found.  It is known from partial skulls and skeletons from at least four individuals of differing biological ages, found in Tithonian (Late Jurassic) rocks of the Morrison Formation in Colorado.  \"Fruitadens\" is the smallest known ornithischian dinosaur, with young adults estimated at 65 to in length and 0.5 to in weight.

The etymology of \"Sphaerotholus\" is a combination of the Greek \"sphaira\", meaning \"ball\", and \"tholos\", meaning \"dome\", and is a reference to the characteristically dome-shaped pachycephalosaurian skull.  The survival of \"Sphaerotholus\" from the Campanian of New Mexico to the end of the Maastrichtian of Montana demonstrates that this taxon had both a relatively long duration (approximately 7-8 million years) and a widespread distribution.  Williamson and Carr, who first described the genus in 2002, diagnose it as follows: \"Differs from all other pachycephalosaurids where known in the possession of a parietosquamosal bar that decreases in depth laterally as seen in caudal view and is bordered by a single row of nodes and one lateroventral corner node.\"  \"Sphaerotholus\" is considered a highly derived pachycephalosaur.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>McFarland, USA (also known as McFarland) is a 2015 American sports drama film directed by Niki Caro, produced by Mark Ciardi and Gordon Gray, written by Christopher Cleveland, Bettina Gilois and Grant Thompson with music composed by Antônio Pinto.

The question mentions \"Works by Hanna Leena Kristiina Varis\" and asks about the collection in a museum that houses approximately 65,000 something.\n\n2. From the context, we have the sentence:  \n   ##begin_quote##  \n   \"She has held over 70 solo exhibitions and participated at over 140 group exhibitions.

This sentence clearly states that her works are part of major art collections in Finland and abroad, including the Albertina Museum.\n\n4. The key phrase here is:  \n   ##begin_quote##  \n   \"Her works are part of major art collections in Finland and abroad, such as the Kiasma, Amos Anderson Art Museum, and Helsinki Art Museum in Helsinki, Wäinö Aaltonen Museum of Art in Turku, and Albertina Museum in Vienna.\"  \n   ##end_quote##\n\n5. The Albertina Museum is specifically mentioned as one of the major art collections in Finland and abroad.\n\n6. Therefore, the museum that houses approximately 65,000 works by Hanna Leena Kristiina Varis is the Albertina Museum.\n\n7.

Recorded in London without the other Beatles, the song features Indian instrumentation such as sitar, dilruba and tabla, and was performed by Harrison and members of the Asian Music Circle.  The recording marked a significant departure from the Beatles' previous work; musically, it evokes the Indian devotional tradition, while the overtly spiritual quality of the lyrics reflects Harrison's absorption in Hindu philosophy and the teachings of the Vedas.

Inscribed the \"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\", the trophy was first awarded to Canada's amateur ice hockey clubs who won the trophy as the result of challenge games and league play.  Professional clubs came to dominate the competition in the early years of the twentieth century, and in 1913 the two major professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) (forerunner of the NHL) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other in an annual series for the Stanley Cup.

Identify the historian Georges-Henri Bousquet translated:\n   ##begin_quote##\n   \"He is also known for his translation work of the great Muslim authors, Al-Ghazali, a theologian who died in 1111 and Tunisian historian Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406).\"\n   ##end_quote##\n   This tells us that Georges-Henri Bousquet translated Al-Ghazali and Ibn Khaldun.\n\n2.

The cyclone was first noted on January 5, 1988 as a weak tropical depression to the northeast of Tuvalu, in conjunction with the future Typhoon Roy in the North-Western Pacific basin.  Over the next few days, the system gradually developed while moving southwestward.  Once it became a tropical cyclone, it was named Anne on January 8.  The next day, Anne rapidly intensified, becoming the fourth major tropical cyclone to affect Vanuatu within four years.  On January 11, Anne peaked in intensity while it was equivalent to a Category 5 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, and a Category 4 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale.  After turning southward on January 12, Anne struck New Caledonia, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to affect the French Overseas Territory.  The system subsequently weakened as it started to interact with Tropical Cyclone Agi.  Anne weakened into a depression and was last noted on January 14 to the south-east of New Caledonia.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The 1999 Odisha cyclone (IMD designation BOB 03, JTWC designation 05B) was the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in the North Indian Ocean and among the most destructive in the region.  The 1999 Odisha cyclone organized into a tropical depression in the Andaman Sea on 25 October, though its origins could be traced back to an area of storms in the Sulu Sea four days prior.  The disturbance gradually strengthened as it took a west-northwesterly path, reaching cyclonic storm strength the next day.  Taking advantage of highly favorable conditions, the storm rapidly intensified, attaining super cyclonic storm intensity on 28 October before peaking with winds of 260 km/h (160 mph) and a record-low pressure of 912 mbar (hPa; 26.93 inHg).  The storm maintained this intensity as it made landfall on Odisha on 29 October.  The cyclone steadily weakened due to persistent land interaction and dry air, remaining quasi-stationary for two days before slowly drifting offshore as a much weaker system; the storm dissipated on 1 November over the Bay of Bengal.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Severe Tropical Cyclone Esau became the strongest tropical cyclone to affect New Caledonia on record during February and March 1992.  A shallow tropical depression developed within the monsoon trough during 24 February, about 370  km (230 mi) to the northeast of Port Vila, Vanuatu.  Over the next day the system gradually developed further as it moved towards the south-west under the influence of a northerly steering flow, before it passed over Pentecost Island in northern Vanuatu during 25 February.  After passing over Pentecost the system continued to move towards the southwest and passed near the island of Malampa, before the depression turned northwards and executed a small clockwise loop as it passed over the island of Espiritu Santo.  The system was subsequently named Esau during 26 February, after it had developed into a tropical cyclone.  Over the next couple of days the system moved south-westwards towards Australia and away from the islands of Vanuatu.  Esau subsequently executed a second clockwise loop during 28 February, before it peaked as a Category 4 tropical cyclone on both the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.  After it had peaked the system moved south-eastwards and threatened Southern Vanuatu, before turning southwards and threatening the French overseas territory of New Caledonia.  Esau made landfall on the French territory during 4 March, as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone before degenerating into an extratropical cyclone during 5 March.

The third tropical cyclone and first intense tropical cyclone of the season, Hondo developed out of a tropical disturbance in early February about 1,020 km (635 mi) east-southeast of Diego Garcia.  The disturbance quickly strengthened, becoming a moderate tropical storm on February 4 and a severe tropical storm the following day.  After a brief period of slower intensification, Hondo rapidly intensified into an intense tropical cyclone and reached its peak intensity with winds of 215 km/h (130 mph ) on February 7.  The cyclone gradually weakened over the next several days due to an increase in forward speed and a decrease in sea surface temperatures.  On February 12, Hondo rapidly degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area.  Over the following week, the remnant low traveled in a general west-northwest direction with no development.  On February 20, about 2,780 km (1,725 mi) northeast of where the final advisories were issued, the storm began to regenerate.  The next day, advisories were issued on Tropical Disturbance Ex-Hondo, which briefly strengthened into a tropical depression.

Dr. Martin Luther King Drive in the Douglas community area of Chicago, Illinois.  Built in 1921, the building served as the headquarters of the Supreme Life Insurance Company, which was founded two years earlier.  The company, originally known as the Liberty Life Insurance Company, was the first African-American owned insurance company in the northern United States.  Since white-owned insurance firms regularly denied black customers life insurance when the firm was founded, the firm played an important role in providing life insurance to Chicago's African-American community.  The company ultimately became the largest African-American owned business in the northern states and became a symbol of the predominantly black Bronzeville neighborhood's economic success from the 1920s to the 1950s.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>712 5th Avenue is a 650 ft skyscraper at 56th Street and Fifth Avenue in the Midtown neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.  It was constructed from 1990 to 1991 and is the 53rd tallest building in New York City.  The tower's design had to accommodate the landmarked facades of the Coty and Rizzoli Buildings at the base of the tower.  It was purchased by the Bannister Trust in 2007 in a \"Private Treaty\", and placed in \"Property Fund #1\" managed by JP Morgan.  The building is sometimes referred to as the Henri Bendel building.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Whole life insurance, or whole of life assurance (in the Commonwealth of Nations), sometimes called \"straight life\" or \"ordinary life,\" is a life insurance policy which is guaranteed to remain in force for the insured's entire lifetime, provided required premiums are paid, or to the maturity date.  As a life insurance policy it represents a contract between the insured and insurer that as long as the contract terms are met, the insurer will pay the death benefit of the policy to the policy's beneficiaries when the insured dies.  Because whole life policies are guaranteed to remain in force as long as the required premiums are paid, the premiums are typically much higher than those of term life insurance where the premium is fixed only for a limited term.  Whole life premiums are fixed, based on the age of issue, and usually do not increase with age.  The insured party normally pays premiums until death, except for limited pay policies which may be paid-up in 10 years, 20 years, or at age 65.  Whole life insurance belongs to the cash value category of life insurance, which also includes universal life, variable life, and endowment policies.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The Flatiron Building, originally the Fuller Building, is a triangular 22-story steel-framed landmarked building located at 175 Fifth Avenue in the borough of Manhattan, New York City, and is considered to be a groundbreaking skyscraper.

The building sits on a triangular block formed by Fifth Avenue, Broadway, and East 22nd Street, with 23rd Street grazing the triangle's northern (uptown) peak.

The company ultimately became the largest African-American owned business in the northern states and became a symbol of the predominantly black Bronzeville neighborhood's economic success from the 1920s to the 1950s.", "712 5th Avenue is a 650 ft skyscraper at 56th Street and Fifth Avenue in the Midtown neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.

The tower's design had to accommodate the landmarked facades of the Coty and Rizzoli Buildings at the base of the tower.  It was purchased by the Bannister Trust in 2007 in a \"Private Treaty\", and placed in \"Property Fund #1\" managed by JP Morgan.

As a life insurance policy it represents a contract between the insured and insurer that as long as the contract terms are met, the insurer will pay the death benefit of the policy to the policy's beneficiaries when the insured dies.  Because whole life policies are guaranteed to remain in force as long as the required premiums are paid, the premiums are typically much higher than those of term life insurance where the premium is fixed only for a limited term.  Whole life premiums are fixed, based on the age of issue, and usually do not increase with age.  The insured party normally pays premiums until death, except for limited pay policies which may be paid-up in 10 years, 20 years, or at age 65.  Whole life insurance belongs to the cash value category of life insurance, which also includes universal life, variable life, and endowment policies.", "The Flatiron Building, originally the Fuller Building, is a triangular 22-story steel-framed landmarked building located at 175 Fifth Avenue in the borough of Manhattan, New York City, and is considered to be a groundbreaking skyscraper.

The building sits on a triangular block formed by Fifth Avenue, Broadway, and East 22nd Street, with 23rd Street grazing the triangle's northern (uptown) peak.

The sister ethnic group of Americo-Liberians are the Sierra Leone Creole people, who shared similar ancestry and related culture.  Americo-Liberians trace their ancestry to free-born and formerly enslaved African Americans who immigrated in the 19th century to become the founders of the state of Liberia.  They identified there as Americo Liberians.  (Some African Americans, following resettlement in Canada, also participated as founding settlers in Sierra Leone and present-day Côte d'Ivoire.)  Although the terms \"Americo-Liberian\" and \"Congo\" had distinct definitions in the nineteenth century, the terms \"Americo-Liberian\" and \"Congo\" are currently interchangeable and refer to an ethnic group composed of the descendants of the various free and ex-slave African American, Caribbean, Recaptive, and Sierra Leone Creoles who settled in Liberia from 1822.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>People of Irish descent form the largest ethnic group in the city of Philadelphia and its surrounding counties.  The Irish have lived in Philadelphia since the pre-American Revolution period.  Irishmen had participated in pro-Revolutionary activities in Philadelphia during the Revolutionary War.  Like many American cities in the 19th century, Philadelphia, which was once a Quaker stronghold, changed dramatically with the influx of European immigrants.  The first major influx of Irish came in 1844 from rural areas, spurred by the Irish Famine.  Because of the Quakers belief and pledge of religious tolerance, Irish Catholics and Protestants, amongst others, made the city incredibly diverse.  Philadelphia at the time had a need for industrial labor, and at the time Philadelphia was becoming a major industrial center in the United States.  Irish took industrial positions.  In the 1840s and 1850s, anti-Catholic sentiment grew against the Irish, and eventually led up to riots, such as the Philadelphia nativist riots and the Lombard Street riot.  Eventually the Irish gained financial and social status in the latter half of the 19th Century and founded institutions during the period.</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The Shiners' War was a conflict between Irish Catholic immigrants and French Canadians in Bytown from 1835 to 1845.  The war started when Peter Aylen, a major Irish timber operator, organized a group of Irishmen to attack other timber operations.

The question asks for the name of an ethnic group that settled in Canada in the 17th century and participated in a conflict with Irish Catholic immigrants in the Shiners' War.\n\n2.

The question asks about the status of One Raffles Place in relation to other buildings in Singapore.\n\n2. The context states: ##begin_quote## \"One Raffles Place, formerly Overseas Union Bank Centre or OUB Centre is one of the tallest skyscrapers in the city of Singapore.\" ##end_quote##\n\n3.

In Major League Baseball (MLB), it is calculated by dividing a player's hits by his at bats (AB).  In MLB, a player in each league wins the \"batting title\" each season for having the highest batting average that year.  The American League (AL) winner is known as the \"Rod Carew American League Batting Champion\", while the National League (NL) leader is designated the \"Tony Gwynn National League Batting Champion\".  Under current rules, a player must have 3.1 plate appearances (PA) per team game (for a total of 502 over the current 162-game season) to qualify for the batting title.  However, if a player's lead in AVG is sufficiently large that enough hitless at bats can be added to reach this requirement and the player still would have the highest batting average, he wins the title.  Tony Gwynn, for example, had 159 hits in 451 ABs in 1996 (.353 average) but only 498 PAs.  Gwynn's batting average would have dropped to.349 (159 hits in 455 ABs) with four hitless ABs added to reach the 502 PA requirement, but this would still have been higher than the next-highest eligible player (.344 average), so he was awarded the 1996 NL batting title.</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n            Answer this question using the information given in the context above.

They are anabolic and increase protein within cells, especially in skeletal muscles, and also have varying degrees of androgenic and virilizing effects, including induction of the development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics such as the growth of the vocal cords and body hair.  The word \"anabolic\", referring to anabolism, comes from the Greek ἀναβολή \"anabole\", \"that which is thrown up, mound.\"  They are one of three types of sex hormone agonists, the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone.", "The Belling-Lee connector or IEC 61169-2 radio-frequency coaxial connector of type 9,52, known colloquially in countries where it is used as a TV antenna connector as a PAL antenna connector, IEC antenna connector, or simply as a TV aerial plug, is commonly used in Europe and Australia to connect coaxial cables with each other and with terrestrial VHF/UHF roof antennas, antenna signal amplifiers, CATV distribution equipment, TV sets, and FM and DAB radio receivers.

The term STOLport did not appear to be in common usage as of 2008 although was commonly used by pilots flying into Biggin Hill during 1986/87 when the London City airport was opened restricting approaches and ceilings to the north of Biggin.  A STOLport normally had a short single runway, in general shorter than 5000 ft .  STOLports only accepted certain types of aircraft, often only smaller propeller aircraft, often with limits on the amount of fuel that can be taken.

The playing time is set by agreement from all players, e.g. 2 hours, and the winner is determined by the monetary sum of all player cash, companies, insurance or other assets.  The game can also end when there are no more companies, advertisements in the bank or bonds in the treasury.  Another objective of the game is \"to teach players some of the fundamentals of economics, and the ways in which the economy and the government interact.\"  Different editions were published for several different countries.

The playing time is set by agreement from all players, e.g. 2 hours, and the winner is determined by the monetary sum of all player cash, companies, insurance or other assets.  The game can also end when there are no more companies, advertisements in the bank or bonds in the treasury.

The outbreak was most notable due to a tornado that hit a densely populated area of the Dallas–Fort Worth metropolitan area, killing 10 people and injuring 200 or more.
